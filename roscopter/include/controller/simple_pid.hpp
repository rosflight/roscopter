 * \brief The simplePID class is a basic, tried and true PID controller.  Only P (proportional) gains are
 *  necessary, the I (integral) and D (derivative) default to zero. The I control is computed using a
 *  first-order numerical integral of the error, the derivative is the numerical first-order derivative
 *  of the error.  Due to these crude integration techniques, it is best if the control be computed fast
 *  (i.e. small dt).
