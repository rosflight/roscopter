# ROScopter 

ROScopter development for ROS2 is still under development. Please refer to [the website](www.rosflight.org) for more information.

If you are coming from ROSplane, you can launch the simulator for a multirotor by replacing all instances of `fixedwing` with `multirotor` in the launching instructions.
